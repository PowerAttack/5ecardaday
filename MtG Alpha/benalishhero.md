***A Caste Above.*** In Benalia, there is a complex caste system in place which shifts and changes with the process of the lunar year. All castes are derived from one of seven clans, giving each citizen of Benalia a designated position in society at birth. Despite the changing structure of Benalish society, there is one caste which always holds a high position of authority, demanding respect from all- the caste of the hero. Heroes within the Benalish caste system must be awarded this caste in a dual ceremony performed both by a religious and a political leader, and are usually granted this honor after proving themselves to be warriors of the highest caliber. Once named as a true member of the Hero caste, a Hero may never lose their position in this caste. Even Heroes who have retired to more peaceful living situations still draw gazes of admiration from those who know them.

***Outside the Lines.*** Once named to the Hero caste, a Benalish citizen is still considered part of their former clan caste, but they are not subject to many of the laws and restrictions of the system. Benalish citizens who are elevated to the Hero caste are always considered to be a Hero first and a member of their clan second. This is because, beyond their duties as guardians of Benalia, a Hero is also expected to act a neutral arbiter, capable of intervening and delivering judgement during disputes amongst Benalish citizens. A Hero is also expected to guard and uphold the tenets and ideals of the Benalish caste system, ensuring that each citizen performs their expected duties, and measures up to expectations, including other Heroes.

***Makings of a Hero.*** Members of the Hero caste are incredibly varied, and may come from any other caste or race, but there are a few notable similarities to be found between all Heroes. The first is the remarkable ability to influence others, even staunch foes, into siding with the Hero under difficult circumstances. The second is an inborn spirit of compassion, and a desire to protect others from harm at any cost. Benalish Heroes may often risk their lives on the battlefield in order to ensure that their allies live on to fight another day. Some Benalish citizens believe that members of the Hero caste are born into it, marked from birth and blessed with charisma which seems almost magical, developing other heroic talents later in life. Other disreputable sources spread dark whispers about the ritual which raises a citizen to the Hero caste, claiming that before the ceremony, behind closed and tightly locked doors, magical rituals grant soon-to-be Heroes with the skills necessary to defend Benalia, including an almost fanatical desire to uphold the rigidity of the caste system.

> ##### Rewards of the Hero Caste
> In Benalia, citizenship is hard to come by, and rarely sought by those who don't seek a particular type of rigidity in their lives. However, appointment to the Hero caste might come with a few particular perks, such as the ability to use Benalish mage-smiths to craft magical weapons and armor, access to magical lore stored in the cathedrals of Benalia, and above all, the ability to maintain the adventurer lifestyle. Being granted membership in the Hero caste might serve as a strong reward for adventurers who perform enough favors for Benalia, as well as lead to further adventures dealing with the expectations that the country of Benalia has for their Heroes.
