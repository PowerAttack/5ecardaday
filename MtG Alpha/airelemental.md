# Air Elemental

Differing in immense ways from their wind elemental cousins, but easily confused as being one and the same, air elementals are vicious creatures. Embodying the chaotic forces of storm winds, every one of these elementals is unique in that they are connected at all times to the Elemental Plane of Air. 

***Planar Energies.***
At the center of every air elemental sits a miniature planar portal, which feeds energy from the Elemental Plane of Air directly into the elemental’s body. The other side of these portals sit very near to the edge of the elemental planes, close to the Demiplane of Lightning, in the Sea of Storms. Air elementals are native to this area, and when they are on their home plane, these miniature planar portals disappear for a time. It is only when an air elemental is summoned to another plane that the connection resumes.

***Power of the Storm.***
Air elementals are capable of using the howling gales which power their bodies to force the air around them to move at dizzying speeds. These gale force winds allows them to cause lacerations simply by moving near a creature. In addition, they may summon up the elemental power they harbor within them to expel bursts of air, thunder, and lightning to blow away nearby threats, along with any other loose objects caught in the blast.

***Undetectable Movement.***
Despite their aggression, air elementals are actually very physically weak, only capable of interacting with the world around them using compressed air expelled from their bodies. This physical weakness, combined with their quick movements, cause air elementals to nearly disappear when they move, making them almost impossible to spot without the aid of magic. The air elementals have learned to use this to their advantage, ambushing creatures from thin air before quickly disappearing again in the confusion, making quick work of prey using hit-and-run tactics.

>***Gone with the Wind.*** Whenever the elemental moves, it becomes invisible for the duration of its movement. Once per turn, while invisible in this way, the elemental may make a single slash attack against a creature within reach. The elemental has advantage on this attack.

>***Wind Power.*** Whenever a spell or effect would cause the elemental to make a Strength saving throw, it may make a Dexterity saving throw instead.
> ### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The air elemental makes three slash attacks.

> ***Slash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit* 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage.

> ***Storm Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The air elemental summons a raging burst of wind, lightning, and thunder from deep within its body. Each creature in a 30 foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 9 (2d10) lightning damage and 9 (2d10) thunder damage and are pushed back 10 feet. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage, and is not pushed back. Any object in the cone not acnhored to the ground and not being worn or carried is pushed 30 feet directly away from the elemental. If a creature is in the path of an object pushed this way, that creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save.
